###  Big Idea
Create a program that generates food recipes that fit user criteria such as cuisine, dietary restrictions, or nutritional goals.

### Learning Goals
* Using new APIs and scraping techniques to interact with websites and parse website data.

* Improve text analysis skills in python through enhanced data cleaning and other methods.

* Collaborating through GitHub and simulate a real life coding project.


### Implementation Plan
* Look through available food APIs on the internet and decide on a suitable one that meets our needs. 

* Read through the documentation to understand the inner workings of the API and the structure of the data it returns.

* Classify each recipe into certain categories for each of the user’s possible criterion.

* Aggregate user’s criteria to sort recipes.

* Finally return a randomized recipe from the list of suitable recipes.

### Collaboration Plan
* One team member created a master repository that would be the base of the program. The other team member forked the repository to facilitate digital collaboration.

* Timely team meeting to brainstorm ideas and some possible pair programming and debugging.

### Risks
* Risk of being unable to obtain relevant data due to proprietary issues or to understand the data structure.

* A real risk for the success of the project will be the team’s ability to sufficiently clean the data of words in job descriptions that are not indicative of requirements

* Another risk will be the team’s ability to accurately categorize different words that describe the same skill into one “box” without excluding any requirements or generalizing
